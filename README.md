This project open source the data set used in the SingSense-2022 paper.

Two datasets were used in Experiment. 

I. Electronic Store Dataset.

This experiment was performed using a laptop equipped with a high-end sound card, which collected data from roughly 100 types of electrical appliance in an electronic store. 

Data collection was performed at three different days of different weeks, each of which involved collecting 2-minute acoustic traces sampled at 192kHz. 

The total dataset exceeded 10GB. 

II. Laboratory Dataset. 

Within a laboratory environment, we simultaneously collected data from 10 of the 100 home appliances using 4 mobile phones (iPhone 8, Ipad Pro 2018, OPPO R11, XiaoMi K20, 48kHz) as well as the above-mentioned sound card. Similarly, we collected traces in 2-minute sessions performed everyday at three different days of different weeks. 

All data can be downloaded for free.


Now the datasets are being processed to remove private audiable humans voice signals collected. You can access them by the link:

For the space limitation by Google Drive, only parts of data (in total 15 GB) updated in the link.
